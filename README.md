# new cdn for hosting

just another repo hosting scripts i use a lot in projects.

this repo is also hosted at [gitea](https://gitea.mcalec.dev/mcalec-dev/cdn/)

either use [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mcalec-dev/cdn@latest/`) for cdn hosting or [githack.com](https://githack.com/) for direct hosting.
